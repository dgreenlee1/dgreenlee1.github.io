The purpose of this application is to create a personal professional webpage for myself and host it using Github Pages.

Right now I'm learning Javascript, using the Phaser plugin to create a game web app. 
I plan to user Phaser's tutorials for basic concepts, then move on to Shakuro's tutorial for intermediate steps.
